#Go Card Deck

This repository contains a Go project that simulates a deck of playing cards. It demonstrates various Go programming concepts, including custom type declarations, slice manipulation, file I/O, and testing practices. The code follows the tutorial from "Go: The Complete Developer's Guide (Golang)" on Udemy, adapted and extended with additional functionality.

##Features

**Deck Creation:** Generate a standard deck of playing cards.
**Shuffling:** Randomly shuffle the cards in the deck.
**Dealing:** Deal a specified number of cards from the deck.
**Saving/Loading:** Save a deck to a file and load it back into the program.
**Custom Type:** Utilizes Go's custom type capabilities for deck manipulation.
